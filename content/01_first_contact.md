Probably in this first post I should be talking about the Corona crisis, what it's doing to me, what implication it has on schooling and the school system and so on.

Hm. I guess, this won't be that kind of post!

We have day number "I don't know and I don't give a f\*\*\*". It is Easter Monday and the sun is shining! So life is relatively great!
It got a little windy and the earth is already dried out, although February was a very wet Month. But life is good! I appreciate it, at the moment. And that comes from someone pessimistic.
During the last week I finished my self made respirator, which I made from old linen and with only my bare hands, needle and thread. And everybody who has sewed multiple layers of cotton linen by hand, knows how hard this can get ;D.
My respirator looks like a Frankenstein version of one made from someone more experienced with sewing then me, but I'm so so proud! 
I love my "child", no matter how ugly it is <3!!!! That's the unconditionally love of a parent :).

So boys and girls, stay save! Be kind, take care for each other and let's do our best to use Corona to prepare and make the right decisions for our future society and our future self. Be the change you want to see!!

OK, maybe another Corona post \**yiks*\*.

Mic drop!
